# This uses BNDF wall temperature output of FDS. 
# FDS and ABAQUS geometries are matching, translation and
# rotation is not needed.
# Each FDS patch (bndf surface) is matched to the corresponding
# ABAQUS nset using the connectivity file nset_bndfA.in

# Basic settings

fds_input  fds_tc4_2.fds
fem_input  TC4_m1A.inp

# NSET-DEVC/BNDF connectivity
# The connectivity file should usually be given. Without a
# Abaqus nset list, the FDS data is mapped to all Abaqus
# nsets and this is usually not wanted.
# The Abaqus node set has nodes at both the outside and 
# the inside of the hollow column, so the user should give
# the correct nset and connect it to all FDS patches.
# FDS patch 1 is the y=-1.5 face (ior=-2 for bndf_face(ior))
# FDS patch 2 is the x=-1.5 face (ior=-1 for bndf_face(ior))
# FDS patch 3 is the x=+1.5 face (ior=+1 for bndf_face(ior))
# FDS patch 4 is the y=+1.5 face (ior=+2 for bndf_face(ior))
