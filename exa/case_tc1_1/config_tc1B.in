# This uses BNDF wall temperature output of FDS. 
# FDS and ABAQUS geometries are matching, no translation nor
# rotation is needed.
# ABAQUS all nsets are used and all FDS patches are used, i.e.,
# no nset connectivity file is given.

# Basic settings

fds_input  fds_tc1_1.fds
fem_input  TC1_m1B.inp
fem_mode   abaqus
fds_output bndf

# Transfer quantity
quantity   wall_temperature

# NSET-DEVC/BNDF connectivity
# The connectivity file should usually be given. Without a
# Abaqus nset list, the FDS data is mapped to all Abaqus
# nsets and this is usually not wanted.
#
# FDS patches (patch number = number of the bndf_face input)
#  1: -0.3,0, -0.3,0, 0.035,0.035  => insulator-2
#  2: 0,0.3,  0,0.3,  0.035,0.035  => insulator-1
#  3: -0.3,0, 0,0.3,  0.035,0.035  => steel-2
#  4: 0,0.3,  -0.3,0, 0.035,0.035  => steel-1
# Now no connectivities are given, all FDS data is used at all FEM patches
# User should give the nearest neighbor mapping parameters so that no wrong
# FDS data is to be mapped to the patches.
