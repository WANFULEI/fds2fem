# This uses BNDF wall temperature output of FDS. 
# FDS and ABAQUS geometries are not matching, translation and
# rotation is needed.
# Each FDS patch (bndf surface) is matched to the corresponding
# ABAQUS nset using the connectivity file nset_bndfA.in

# Basic settings

# NSET-DEVC/BNDF connectivity
# The connectivity file should usually be given. Without a
# Abaqus nset list, the FDS data is mapped to all Abaqus
# nsets and this is usually not wanted.

# Note that the FDS input uses MULT to create the OBSTs so
# that there will be many patches. In total, 50 patches are
# written to the BNDF file.
# Note: No FDS patches are given on the nset file for the FEM nsets.
#       Thus, all FDS parches are used. So, if you want to use all
#       FDS patches for (some) nset, then the line just has the
#       nset name.
